# Logics
This repository aims to provide a playground for different formal logics, which includes pretty printing, simplification, rewriting, and (satisfiability) solvers.
All code here is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production.

### Supported logics
- Prepositional logic P(¬, ∨, ∧)
  - Pretty printing
  - Poor man's simplification
  - CNF conversion 
  - DPLL SAT solving
